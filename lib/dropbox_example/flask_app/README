This is a simple Flask example app that shows how to link with a user's Dropbox
via the Python SDK.

How to use
----------

1. Edit the configuration in the flask_dropbox.py file. You'll need to set the
   DROPBOX_APP_KEY and DROPBOX_APP_SECRET to the app key and app secret of your
   Dropbox app.

2. Now you can run the flaskr_dropbox.py file with your python interpreter and
   the application will greet you on http://localhost:5000/.
